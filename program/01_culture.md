# Creating a Data Culture

| Overview: 40 min |
| ---------------- |

### Overview

### <a id="a1">[What is data culture?](#f2 "Data Therapy: You Don’t Need a Data Scientist, You Need a Data Culture")</a>

Beyond the buzz words, what does this mean?

Data Therapy suggests that the following list characterises businesses
which have a data culture:

> *	Leadership prioritizes and invests in data collection, management, and analytics

> *	Leadership prioritizes creative data literacy for the whole organization

> *	Staff are encouraged and supported to access, combine and derive insight from the organization’s data

> *	Staff recognize useful data when they see it. They offer creative ways to use the organizations data to solve problems, make decisions and tell stories

There are a number of facets to unpack here.

The first is that data is treated as an asset.

Beyond this, the business create capability to **realize value** from this data. That is, it doesn't sit around in a warehouse, it earns its keep.

Data alone is not valuable (especially if it's not *valued*), but when combined with domain insight and rich metadata, it can be leveraged to create value. The better your data management and data *enrichment*, the longer your data will remain useful.

The other major facet of this list is around enabling people (three of these four points).
### Why build a data culture?

Some of the more common reasons for developing a data culture are to:

*	**Optimize operations**

  Measuring delivery performance and changing how it worked and doing it again.

  *This is one of the more common purposes, especially in a data rich environment.*

*	**Spread a message**

  Using data to tell a story and communicate impact.

  *Communicating information is part of our daily routines, and a data culture might help us do it better, especially when we're talking about the bigger-picture.*

* **Bring people together**

  How can you use data to break down silos and strengthen partnerships across organization?

  *This is one which is less often a core aim, but is an important part of
  this program.*

### Styles of Data-oriented Businesses

There are different styles of data-oriented businesses, each with different uses for data:

* When you’re **data-centric**, you bring people together around data as the central driver to help make decisions

*	When you’re **data-informed**, you take the data and its context as inputs to your conversation and decision-making process

*	When you’re **data-driven** - using data to make decisions directly - removing the human from the loop

Recognize that it’s not either-or, and that all organizations can use a combination of all three approaches.

| :question: Where are each of these approaches useful? |
|:----------------------------------------------------- |

When working with each of these styles, you'll find that they tend
to emphasise different aspects, particularly with regards to outputs. For example **data-centric** businesses will try to enable discussions around
data, and facilitate curiosity-driven exploratory work, while **data-informed** businesses may focus on reporting and risk communication. But for **data-driven** businesses, these aspects will likely be secondary, and they may instead focus on enabling machine-to-machine
data and information transfer. Some of this will come down to what you
wish to achieve. If your aims are largely around optimization, you'll
be in the **data-driven** space, while aims centred around
communication and reporting will fall in the other categories.

### Roadblocks to Data Culture

There's a number of things which get in the way of a data culture, especially on the scale of entire organisations. Below we've listed Data Therapy's three key aspects which tend to get in the way,  why, and how you might handle them.

| Aspect         | Description                                                          | Solutions                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Confidence** | Organizations are not confident that they can be google.             | Build with small examples.      |
| **Technology** | Appears daunting, expensive and requires technical expertise.        | Start with simple tech.         |
| **Process**    | No laid-out process for working with data<sup id="a2">[#](#f2)</sup>. | Follow a step-by-step approach. |


| :question: What else might stop you getting started with data science problems? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


| :question: What happens when data-focused business activities are contained within a single part of the organisation? |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Data Literacy

A key aspect of developing a data culture is **data literacy**. What does this mean? Overall, it's the ability to:

* Read data
* Work with data
* Analyse data
* Argue with data

You might notice some similarities to the core skills program, which implicitly aims to help you build skills to climb this hierarchy of data literacy.

Why does this matter? You can't develop a **data-driven** business if you have low levels of data literacy. You might be able to generate data, but turning it into value will be arduous.

Recognize that you will be dealing with different parts of the organization with different data *literacies*.

### Where does data science sit within a broader data culture?

Data Literacy vs Data Science

|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## High-Level Data Science Strategies

Building an effective strategy & making progress when you don’t have all the information. A strategy defines how you win. At a high level, a data and analytics strategy must answer questions such as “What data? For what purposes? And by whom?”

At a slightly lower level, a strategy must:
  *	Identify and guide the allocation of critical resources
  *	Define how to measure success
  *	Adapt to changing circumstances dynamically
  *	Act both proactively and reactively

### Baseline

Start data and analytics initiatives with a baseline measurement of the “as is” state - show a clear path to financial and business objectives.

### Measure Improvements

* **Information Value** (or knowledge gain or sharing)
*	**Business Value** (e.g. improve business processes with data and analytics)
* **Stakeholder Value** (what the data and analytics mean for stakeholders, such as assets, partners, shareholders and society at large)

##	What is my existing data culture?

| Existing Culture: 20 min |
| ------------------------ |

Introduce data literacy model as a way of thinking about the problem – suggest data science, data management, communications

Different stages of ideas about data science:
1. Data are columns in spreadsheets and not connected to business decisions
1. Data are connected to decisions through descriptive statistics (mean, percentiles, range), visualization (what plot is appropriate) and inferential statistics (when does the data support the conclusions)? Train people to make fewer assumptions and plot the data for themselves
1.Modelling process – coming up with your own models for the data making predictions of future states from current states
1. Creating data products – making data speak for others through services and automated predictions

Data Management
1. Data are spread out over the organization with no central point to get data from  
1. Data are pooled and accessible to all staff with descriptive formats
1. Data lifecycles are managed with old data retired. Code and pipelines are managed.
1. Code and pipelines and servers are reused across the organization to add value across silos

Communication ideas:
1.	Data are not recognized
1.	Basic metrics are available and used to drive decisions routinely in other business processes
1.	Data are used to tell stories & show impact
1.	Data are used to argue for particular courses of action
