# Creating a Data Culture

## What is Data Culture?

### Overview

### [What is data culture?]

> *	Leadership prioritizes and invests in data collection management and analytics
> *	Leadership prioritizes creative data literacy for the whole organization
> *	Staff are encouraged and supported to access, combine and derive insight from the organization’s data
> *	Staff recognize useful data when they see it. They offer creative ways to use the organizations data to solve problems, make decisions and tell stories

### Why build a data culture?

*	**Optimize operations**

  Measuring delivery performance and changing how it worked and doing it again

* **Bring people together**

  How can you use data to break down silos and strengthen partnerships across organization?

*	**Spread a message**

  Using data to tell a story and communicate impact

There are different styles of data-oriented businesses, each with different uses for data:

* When you’re **data-centric**, you bring people together around data as the central driver to help make decisions

*	When you’re **data-informed**, you take the data and its context as inputs to your conversation and decision-making process

*	When you’re **data-driven** - using data to make decisions directly - removing the human from the loop
Recognize that it’s not either-or, and that all organizations can use a combination of all three approaches.

What are the roadblocks to getting started with data science problems? How will we handle these?

| Aspect         | Description                                                                                                     | Solutions                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Confidence** | Organizations are not confident that they can be google.                                                                 | Build with small examples.     |
| **Technology** | Appears daunting, expensive and requires technical expertise.                                                   | Start with simple tech.        |
| **Process**    | Organizations have no laid-out process for working with data<sup>[#]</sup>  | Follow a step-by-step approach. |

## Data Science in Context

### Defining Data Science

| :question: How you would define data science? |
|:--------------------------------------------- |


### Data Literacy

Recognize that you will be dealing with different parts of the organization with different data *literacies*.

Data Literacy vs Data Science:

* Ability to read data
* Ability to work with data
* Analysing data
* Arguing with data

### Where does data science sit within a broader data culture?

| :question: Where do data scientists connect within the three types of business we’ve just described? |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Data Science Workflows

### Data Science Workflow

### Key Differentiator: Speed & Iterative Improvement

*	Ideate
* Consolidate
* Implement:
  – Draft, Refine, Optimize

### How do we make prototypes quickly?
*	Be prepared to kill what you’ve built if something better comes along. Avoid the [IKEA Effect]!

## High-Level Data Science Strategies

Building an effective strategy & making progress when you don’t have all the information. A strategy defines how you win. At a high level, a data and analytics strategy must answer questions such as “What data? For what purposes? And by whom?”

1. At a slightly lower level, a strategy must:
  *	Identify and guide the allocation of critical resources
  *	Define how to measure success
  *	Adapt to changing circumstances dynamically
  *	Act both proactively and reactively

### Baseline

Start data and analytics initiatives with a baseline measurement of the “as is” state - show a clear path to financial and business objectives.

### Measure Improvements

* **Information Value** (or knowledge gain or sharing)
*	**Business Value** (e.g. improve business processes with data and analytics)
* **Stakeholder Value** (what the data and analytics mean for stakeholders, such as assets, partners, shareholders and society at large)

### Maintaining Momentum


## Data Science Teams  

### Parts of an Effective Data Team

The ideal data scientist does not exist, and you need a spectrum of people working together.


| Map these people onto your existing workflow. Who fits in where?                                       |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :question: **Where do you fit on this spectrum of people?**                                            |
| :question: **Where would you like to be?**                                                             |
| :question: **What are the key differences between them?**                                              |
| :question: **What are some of the more important skills which align with where you would like to be?** |
| :question: **Where do you see gaps in your organisation with respect to these roles?**                 |
| :question: **How might you start bridging those gaps?**                                                |


#### Mapping Interfaces

| Map out the interfaces between your team members considering how you work.      |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: **Who manages these interfaces?**                                    |
| :question: **What (data/code/information) needs to flow across them?**          |
| :question: **What does effective leadership look like in a data-focused team?** |



| Map interfaces from your data team to the rest of the business.                         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: **What needs to be supported once you’ve built something?**                  |
| :question: **Who provides that support?**                                               |
| :question: **Who funds your work?**                                                     |
| :question: **How do you measure ongoing value? How do you know when things go wrong?**  |
| :question: **Who manages the new datasets that you’re creating?**                       |
| :question: **Who helps others get confident with the new processes you’ve introduced?** |


Note that all of these interfaces are potential communication barriers.
