# Creating a Data Culture


## What is Data Culture?

| Overview: 40 min |
| ---------------- |

### Overview

### <a id="a2">[What is data culture?](#f2 "Data Therapy: You Don’t Need a Data Scientist, You Need a Data Culture")</a>


> *	Leadership prioritizes and invests in data collection management and analytics
> *	Leadership prioritizes creative data literacy for the whole organization
> *	Staff are encouraged and supported to access, combine and derive insight from the organization’s data
> *	Staff recognize useful data when they see it. They offer creative ways to use the organizations data to solve problems, make decisions and tell stories

### Why build a data culture?

*	**Optimize operations**

  Measuring delivery performance and changing how it worked and doing it again

* **Bring people together**

  How can you use data to break down silos and strengthen partnerships across organization?

*	**Spread a message**

  Using data to tell a story and communicate impact

There are different styles of data-oriented businesses, each with different uses for data:

* When you’re **data-centric**, you bring people together around data as the central driver to help make decisions

*	When you’re **data-informed**, you take the data and its context as inputs to your conversation and decision-making process

*	When you’re **data-driven** - using data to make decisions directly - removing the human from the loop
Recognize that it’s not either-or, and that all organizations can use a combination of all three approaches.

| :question: Where are each of these approaches useful? |
|:----------------------------------------------------- |

What are the roadblocks to getting started with data science problems? How will we handle these?

| Aspect         | Description                                                          | Solutions                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Confidence** | Organizations are not confident that they can be google.             | Build with small examples.      |
| **Technology** | Appears daunting, expensive and requires technical expertise.        | Start with simple tech.         |
| **Process**    | No laid-out process for working with data<sup id="a2">[#](#f2)</sup> | Follow a step-by-step approach. |


### Data Literacy

Recognize that you will be dealing with different parts of the organization with different data *literacies*.

* Ability to read data
* Ability to work with data
* Analysing data
* Arguing with data

### Where does data science sit within a broader data culture?

Data Literacy vs Data Science

| :question: Where do data scientists connect within the three types of business we’ve just described? |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |


## High-Level Data Science Strategies

Building an effective strategy & making progress when you don’t have all the information. A strategy defines how you win. At a high level, a data and analytics strategy must answer questions such as “What data? For what purposes? And by whom?”

At a slightly lower level, a strategy must:
  *	Identify and guide the allocation of critical resources
  *	Define how to measure success
  *	Adapt to changing circumstances dynamically
  *	Act both proactively and reactively

### Baseline

Start data and analytics initiatives with a baseline measurement of the “as is” state - show a clear path to financial and business objectives.

### Measure Improvements

* **Information Value** (or knowledge gain or sharing)
*	**Business Value** (e.g. improve business processes with data and analytics)
* **Stakeholder Value** (what the data and analytics mean for stakeholders, such as assets, partners, shareholders and society at large)

### Maintaining Momentum

##	What is my existing data culture?

| Existing Culture: 20 min |
| ------------------------ |

Introduce data literacy model as a way of thinking about the problem – suggest data science, data management, communications

Different stages of ideas about data science:
1. Data are columns in spreadsheets and not connected to business decisions
1. Data are connected to decisions through descriptive statistics (mean, percentiles, range), visualization (what plot is appropriate) and inferential statistics (when does the data support the conclusions)? Train people to make fewer assumptions and plot the data for themselves
1.Modelling process – coming up with your own models for the data making predictions of future states from current states
1. Creating data products – making data speak for others through services and automated predictions

Data Management
1. Data are spread out over the organization with no central point to get data from  
1. Data are pooled and accessible to all staff with descriptive formats
1. Data lifecycles are managed with old data retired. Code and pipelines are managed.
1. Code and pipelines and servers are reused across the organization to add value across silos

Communication ideas:
1.	Data are not recognized
1.	Basic metrics are available and used to drive decisions routinely in other business processes
1.	Data are used to tell stories & show impact
1.	Data are used to argue for particular courses of action
