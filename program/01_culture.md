# Creating a Data Culture

| Overview: 40-45 min |
| ------------------- |

### Overview

### <a id="a1">[What is data culture?](#1 "Data Therapy: You Don’t Need a Data Scientist, You Need a Data Culture")</a>

Beyond the buzz words, what does this mean?

Data Therapy suggests that the following list characterises businesses
which have a data culture:

> *	Leadership prioritizes and invests in data collection, management, and analytics

> *	Leadership prioritizes creative data literacy for the whole organization

> *	Staff are encouraged and supported to access, combine and derive insight from the organization’s data

> *	Staff recognize useful data when they see it. They offer creative ways to use the organizations data to solve problems, make decisions and tell stories

There are a number of facets to unpack here.

The first is that data is treated as an asset.

Beyond this, the business creates capability to **realize value** from this data. That is, it doesn't sit around in a warehouse, it earns its keep.

Data alone is not valuable (especially if it's not *valued*), but when combined with domain insight and rich metadata, it can be leveraged to create value. The better your data management and data *enrichment*, the longer your data will remain useful.

The other major facet of this list is around enabling people (three of these four points). There are many opportunities on the leadership side, but in the end employees need to feel empowered to work with their data.
One aspect of this is working across silos, and leveraging a workforce with common purpose, skills and technology.

### Why build a data culture?

Some of the more common reasons for developing a data culture are to:

*	**Optimize operations**

  Measuring delivery performance and changing how it worked and doing it again.

  *This is one of the more common purposes, especially in a data rich environment.*

*	**Spread a message**

  Using data to tell a story and communicate impact.

  *Communicating information is part of our daily routines, and a data culture might help us do it better, especially when we're talking about the bigger-picture.*

* **Bring people together**

  How can you use data to break down silos and strengthen partnerships across organization?

  *This is one which is less often a core aim, but is an important part of
  this program.*

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
### Data Literacy

**Data literacy** is a key aspect of developing data culture. What does this mean? Overall, it's the ability to:

* Read data
* Work with data
* Analyse data
* Argue with data

You might notice some similarities to the core skills program, which implicitly aims to help you build skills to climb this hierarchy of data literacy.

Why does this matter? You can't develop a **data-driven** business if you have low levels of data literacy. You might be able to generate data, but turning it into value will be arduous.

Recognize that you will be dealing with different parts of the organization with different data *literacies*.

| :question:  What happens when data-focused business activities are contained within a single part of the organisation? |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Roadblocks to Data Culture

There's a number of things which get in the way of a data culture, especially on the scale of entire organisations. Below we've listed Data Therapy's three key aspects which tend to get in the way,  why, and how you might handle them.

| Aspect         | Description                                                           | Solutions                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Confidence** | Organizations are not confident that they can be work with data.      | Build with small examples.      |
| **Technology** | Appears daunting, expensive and requires technical expertise.         | Start with simple tech.         |
| **Process**    | No laid-out process for working with data<sup id="a2">[#](#f2)</sup>. | Follow a step-by-step approach. |


| :question: What else might stop you getting started with data science problems? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Styles of Data-oriented Businesses

There are different styles of data-oriented businesses, each with different uses for data:

* When you’re **data-centric**, you bring people together around data as the central driver to help make decisions

*	When you’re **data-informed**, you take the data and its context as inputs to your conversation and decision-making process

*	When you’re **data-driven**, you use data to make decisions directly - removing the human from the loop

Recognize that it’s not either-or, and that all organizations can use a combination of all three approaches.

| :question: Where are each of these approaches useful? |
|:----------------------------------------------------- |

When working with each of these styles, you'll find that they tend
to emphasise different aspects, particularly with regards to outputs. For example **data-centric** businesses will try to enable discussions around
data, and facilitate curiosity-driven exploratory work, while **data-informed** businesses may focus on reporting and risk communication. But for **data-driven** businesses, these aspects will likely be secondary, and they may instead focus on enabling machine-to-machine
data and information transfer. Some of this will come down to what you
wish to achieve. If your aims are largely around optimization, you'll
be in the **data-driven** space, while aims centred around
communication and reporting will fall in the other categories.

## High-Level Data Science Strategies

A strategy defines how you win. At a high level, a data and analytics strategy must answer questions such as "What data? For what purposes? And by whom?".

At a slightly lower level, a strategy must:
  *	Identify and guide the allocation of critical resources
  *	Define how to measure success
  *	Adapt to changing circumstances dynamically
  *	Act both proactively and reactively

| Identifying, Measuring and Demonstrating Value is Key |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |


### Baseline & Measuring Added Value

Before you begin a journey with data and analytics initiatives, one of the best things you can do is establish where you're starting. From this baseline "as is" state you can then plot a show a clear path to financial and business objectives. Your data and analytics incentives and activities should be linked to generating value for the business.

Decide on what you need to measure to demonstrate change, and to
link this to increasing value. Remember that people measure
what is easy to measure, not what is important to measure.

This could include:

* **Information Value**

  You learn something new, or have greater certainty in your information. Knowledge gain or sharing within the business.

*	**Business Value**

  You do better business: improve business *processes* with data and analytics.

* **Stakeholder Value**

  What the data and analytics mean for stakeholders, such as assets, partners, shareholders and society at large.

| Some questions to consider:                                |
|:---------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What does this data help us do?                 |
| :question: What is missing from this data?                 |
| :question: Are we sharing data in the most effective ways? |
| :question: How do we get different silos to align?         |

| :question: How do you maintain momentum? |
| ---------------------------------------- |

If something isn't working, don't be afraid to change, but continue to
focus on where you could add value.

##	What is my existing data culture?

| Existing Culture: 15-20 min |
| --------------------------- |

The last part of this section will be an opportunity to assess where you and your business are currently. One way to think about this is through the lens of data literacy, considering where yourself and your colleagues fit into this picture. Outside of science, engineering and analytics business areas, does it look similar or different?

We've included three tables below listing some ideas about stages of where your business may sit or be heading towards regarding data science, data management and how well data are used in communication.

| Different stages of ideas about data science:                                                                           |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data are columns in spreadsheets and not connected to business decisions                                                |
| Data are connected to decisions through descriptive statistics, visualization and inferential statistics?               |
| Modelling process – coming up with your own models for the data making predictions of future states from current states |
| Creating data products – making data speak for others through services and automated predictions                        |


| Data Management                                                                             |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data are spread out over the organization with no central point to get data from            |
| Data are pooled and accessible to all staff with descriptive formats                        |
| Data lifecycles are managed with old data retired. Code and pipelines are managed.          |
| Code and pipelines and servers are reused across the organization to add value across silos |


| Communication                                                                                 |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data are not recognized                                                                       |
| Basic metrics are available and used to drive decisions routinely in other business processes |
| Data are used to tell stories & show impact                                                   |
| Data are used to argue for particular courses of action                                       |

In the next section we'll consider where we could make some improvements
to foster a data culture,
and some roadblocks you might encounter.

| :question: Do you feel empowered to make some data-oriented changes in your workplace? |
