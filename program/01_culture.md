# Creating a Data Culture

## What is Data Culture?

1. Overview

1. [What is data culture?]

  > *	Leadership prioritizes and invests in data collection management and analytics
  > *	Leadership prioritizes creative data literacy for the whole organization
  > *	Staff are encouraged and supported to access, combine and derive insight from the organization’s data
  > *	Staff recognize useful data when they see it. They offer creative ways to use the organizations data to solve problems, make decisions and tell stories
1. Why build a data culture?

  *	**Optimize operations**

    Masuring delivery performance and changing how it worked and doing it again

  * **Bring people together**

    How can you use data to break down silos and strengthen partnerships across organization?

  *	**Spread a message**

    Using data to tell a story and communicate impact

1. There are different styles of data-oriented businesses, each with different uses for data:

  * When you’re **data-centric**, you bring people together around data as the central driver to help make decisions

  *	When you’re **data-informed**, you take the data and its context as inputs to your conversation and decision-making process

  *	When you’re **data-driven** - using data to make decisions directly - removing the human from the loop
  Recognize that it’s not either-or, and that all organizations can use a combination of all three approaches.

  | :question: Where are each of these approaches useful? |
  | --------------------------------------------- |

1. What are the roadblocks to getting started with data science problems? How will we handle these?

  | Aspect         | Description                                                                                                     | Solutions                      |
  | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
  | **Confidence** | Organizations are not confident that they can be google.                                                                 | Build with small examples.     |
  | **Technology** | Appears daunting, expensive and requires technical expertise.                                                   | Start with simple tech.        |
  | **Process**    | Organizations have no laid-out process for working with data[1]  | Follow a step-by-step approach. |

## Data Science in Context

1. Defining Data Science

  | :question: How you would define data science? |
  | --------------------------------------------- |


1. Data Literacy

  Recognize that you will be dealing with different parts of the organization with different data *literacies*.

1. Data Literacy vs Data Science
  * Ability to read data
  * Ability to work with data
  * Analysing data
  * Arguing with data

1. Where does data science sit within a broader data culture?

  | :question: Where do data scientists connect within the three types of business we’ve just described? |
  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Data Science Workflows

1. Data Science Workflow

1. Key Differentiator: Speed & Iterative Improvement

  *	Ideate
  * Consolidate
  * Implement:
    – draft, refine, optimize

1. How do we make prototypes quickly?
  *	Be prepared to kill what you’ve built if something better comes along. Avoid the [IKEA Effect]!

## High-Level Data Science Strategies
Building an effective strategy & making progress when you don’t have all the information. A strategy defines how you win. At a high level, a data and analytics strategy must answer questions such as “What data? For what purposes? And by whom?”

1. At a slightly lower level, a strategy must:
  *	Identify and guide the allocation of critical resources
  *	Define how to measure success
  *	Adapt to changing circumstances dynamically
  *	Act both proactively and reactively

1. Baseline

  Start data and analytics initiatives with a baseline measurement of the “as is” state - show a clear path to financial and business objectived.

1. Measure Improvements
  * **Information Value** (or knowledge gain or sharing)
  *	**Business Value** (e.g. improve business processes with data and analytics)
  * **Stakeholder Value** (what the data and analytics mean for stakeholders, such as assets, partners, shareholders and society at large)

1. Maintaining Momentum

## Managing Data for Data Science Workflows

* FAIR Data

## Data Science Teams  

1. Parts of an effective data team
1. Mapping interfaces from your data team to the rest of the business
