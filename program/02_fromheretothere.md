## From There to Here

The first part of this section will address some things which could be
worth changing in your workplace, how you might go about it, and what might
get in the way.

The second part identifies how data science fits in, how it's different
to our typical everyday workflows, and what an effective data team
might look like.

### What needs to change?

| Changes: 25 min |
| --------------- |

When it comes to making change, baby steps are fine. Whether the approach is top-down or bottom-up, there's many things you could implement in your
everyday work. Look for and highlight examples of good practise, look for internal advocates and build external relationships.
Understand what already exists within your team before you try to change a bunch of things.

| Assess where you are:                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Are there data champions already using data in good ways that you can celebrate as good role models?           |
| :question: Are there roles in your organization aligned with your data needs?                                             |
| :question: Is there a central person or team setting policies and best practices when it comes to your data related work? |
| :question: Are there things that are going to break when I introduce a new process?                                       |

You might what to relate some of your potential changes back to the three categories of roadblocks we mentioned earlier:
1.	**confidence** – how do we build confidence in our skills?
2.	**technology** – what platforms should we use and what investments made to get ourselves to the next level?
3.	**process** – what can my organization do to make it easier to get to the next level on the hierarchy?

| Some questions to consider:                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What might you change in your workplace?                     |
| :question: What are *important* changes, and what are *easy* changes?   |
| :question: Who might be a good advocate for implementing some of these? |
| :question: What are the processes which will be difficult to change?    |
| :question: Are there good practises to highlight and popularise?        |
| :question: Where might pushback come from?                              |


### Dealing with Roadblocks

| Roadblocks: 10 min |
| ------------------ |

**Confusion**

Need to use communication methods and language that meets people where they are You will need to teach others to interpret your outputs for themselves

**Not knowing your own data**

How will you keep track of data and assets (more on this tomorrow) How do you identify useful datasets?

**Organizational Silos**

Acknowledge walls but demonstrate value when broken down

**IT-centric thinking**

Infrastructure specific thinking (if I just have a Hadoop platform my analytics problems will be solved) – data is for everybody and Excel is just as much a useful tool as the best biggest data platform – create more invitations for people to work with data

**Irrelevance**

If staff don’t understand the utility of the data they are collecting you will get shit data – KPIs not a key driver – you need staff to understand ‘so what’ – make it relevant to them (often they will know the relevance better than you!)

**Boredom**

Make data something that can be fun for people – creative times to generate new things from data – tell stories about your data share these – data are more than pivot tables!

**HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person’s Opinions)**

When someone more powerful than you just wants to ‘trust their gut’ – importance of experimentation and establishing baselines!


## Data Science in Context

| Overview: 20 min |
| ------------------------------- |


### Defining Data Science

| :question: How you would define data science? |
|:--------------------------------------------- |


### Key Differentiator: Speed & Iterative Improvement

* Ideate
* Consolidate
* Implement:
  * Draft, Refine, Optimize

> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise ( John Tukey)

*	What happens when the jumps are too or too big?
*	Prototype at all points - relate to value add to build momentum
*	Simple tools that everyone can work on

## Data Science Teams

### Parts of an Effective Data Team

Data teams can encompass a variety of different roles, given the breadth of
work undertaken to complete data science projects. Smaller teams may
tend to be more generalist, so perhaps you may not encounter such a diversity of roles.

| How does the work of data scientists overlap with and differ to: |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Data engineers?                                       |
| :question: Database managers?                                    |
| :question: Software developers?                                  |
| :question: Typical researchers?                                  |
| :question: Web developers?                                       |

The ideal data scientist does not exist, and you need a spectrum of people working together.

| Map some of these people onto your workflow. Who fits in where?                                    |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Where do you fit on this spectrum of people?                                            |
| :question:  would you like to be?                                                                  |
| :question: What are the key differences between them?                                              |
| :question: What are some of the more important skills which align with where you would like to be? |
| :question: Where do you see gaps in your organisation with respect to these roles?                 |
| :question: How might you start bridging those gaps?                                                |


#### Mapping Interfaces

| Map out the interfaces between your team members considering how you work.                             |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :question: Who manages these interfaces?                                                               |
| :question: What (data/code/information) needs to flow across them?                                     |
| :question: What does effective leadership look like in a data-focused team?<sup id="a3">[#](#f3)</sup> |


| Map interfaces from your data team to the rest of the business.                         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What needs to be supported once you’ve built something?                  |
| :question: Who provides that support?                                               |
| :question: Who funds your work?                                                     |
| :question: How do you measure ongoing value? How do you know when things go wrong?  |
| :question: Who manages the new datasets that you’re creating?                       |
| :question: Who helps others get confident with the new processes you’ve introduced? |

Note that all of these interfaces are potential communication barriers.

<b id="f3">#</b> One suggestion: Communicate the 'why' (through your data plans/strategy) - let your team own the 'how'. You don’t need to know implementation details! [↩](#a3)
