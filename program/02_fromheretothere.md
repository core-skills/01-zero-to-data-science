| ------ |

The first part of this section will address some things which could be
worth changing in your workplace, how you might go about it, and what might
get in the way.

The second part identifies how data science fits in, how it's different
to our typical everyday workflows, and what an effective data team
might look like.

## What needs to change?

| Changes: 35 min |
| --------------- |

When it comes to making change, baby steps are fine. Whether the approach is top-down or bottom-up, there's many things you could implement in your
everyday work. Look for and highlight examples of good practise, look for internal advocates and build external relationships.
Understand what already exists within your team before you try to change a bunch of things.

| Assess where you are:                                                                                                     |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Are there data champions already using data in good ways that you can celebrate as good role models?           |
| :question: Are there roles in your organization aligned with your data needs?                                             |
| :question: Is there a central person or team setting policies and best practices when it comes to your data related work? |
| :question: Are there things that are going to break when I introduce a new process?                                       |

You might what to relate some of your potential changes back to the three categories of roadblocks we mentioned earlier:
1.	**confidence** – how do we build confidence in our skills?
2.	**technology** – what platforms should we use and what investments made to get ourselves to the next level?
3.	**process** – what can my organization do to make it easier to get to the next level on the hierarchy?

| Some questions to consider:                                             |     |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| :question: What might you change in your workplace?                     |     |
| :question: What are *important* changes, and what are *easy* changes?   |     |
| :question: Who might be a good advocate for implementing some of these? |     |
| :question: What are the processes which will be difficult to change?    |     |
| :question: Are there good practises to highlight and popularise?        |     |
| :question: Where might pushback come from?                              |     |


### Dealing with Roadblocks

**Confusion**

* Use communication methods and language that meets people where they are
* You will need to teach others to interpret your outputs for themselves

**Not knowing your own data**

How will you keep track of data and assets (more on this tomorrow) How do you identify useful datasets?

**Organizational Silos**

Acknowledge walls but demonstrate value when broken down

**IT-centric thinking**

Infrastructure specific thinking (if I just have a Hadoop platform my analytics problems will be solved) – data is for everybody and Excel is just as much a useful tool as the best biggest data platform – create more invitations for people to work with data

**Irrelevance**

If staff don’t understand the utility of the data they are collecting you will get bad data – KPIs not a key driver – you need staff to understand 'so what' – make it relevant to them (often they will know the relevance better than you!)

**Boredom**

Make data something that can be fun for people – creative times to generate new things from data – tell stories about your data share these – data are more than pivot tables!  

**HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person’s Opinions)**

When someone more powerful than you just wants to 'trust their gut' – importance of experimentation and establishing baselines!

## Data Science in Context

### Defining Data Science

| :question: How you would define data science? |
|:--------------------------------------------- |

Data science is the confluence of data analytics, machine learning,
visualisation, communication and often domain knowledge.

While leveraging a number of technical and analytical skills,
data science work is often more creative and involves more 'building'
than typical analysis tasks.

Statistics 2.0?

Data science borrows some core scientific concepts, but differs to the way
in which work is done. In particular, data science contrasts with the relatively linear workflows and timeframes of months to years we experience in typical research and development workflows.

### Key Differentiator: Iterative Improvement & Speed

The key differentiator relative to our existing workflow is iterative development. Because of this, things tend to move quickly.

Data science workflows involve continuously assessing and improving what you're doing. This cycle of improvement could be characterised by a series of stages, the latter of which involves a loop:

* Ideate
* Consolidate
* Implement:
  * Draft, Refine, Optimize

When it comes to getting answers with data science, it's better to get an approximate answer quickly. You can use this as a feedback to quickly improve your models.

> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise ( John Tukey)

At all points, prototype your system, and focus your time on things which you know will add value. Keeping the problem linked to the business value proposition helps to keep momentum.

Build system which everyone can work on. Beyond the adage 'many hands make light work', if you have others involved you'll have better buy-in, and you'll end up with better systems.

When it comes to improving the next system or prototype, consider what appropriate levels of change might be.

### Parts of an Effective Data Team

Data teams can encompass a variety of different roles, given the breadth of
work undertaken to complete data science projects. Smaller teams may
tend to be more generalist, so perhaps you may not encounter such a diversity of roles.

| How does the work of data scientists overlap with and differ to: |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Data engineers?                                       |
| :question: Database managers?                                    |
| :question: Software developers?                                  |
| :question: Typical researchers?                                  |
| :question: Web developers?                                       |
| :question: Data analysts?                                        |

The ideal data scientist does not exist, and you need a spectrum of people working together.

Another thing to consider is how distinct you may want roles
to be, and how closely you connect the members of your data team.

Consider this paragraph describing the LinkdedIn data
team from DJ Patil, ex-LinkedIn Chief Scientist, Chief Security Officer and Head of Analytics and Data Teams:

> It’s important that our data team wasn’t comprised solely of mathematicians and other "data people". It’s a fully integrated product group that includes people working in design, web development, engineering, product marketing, and operations. They all understand and work with data, and I consider them all data scientists. We intentionally kept the distinction between different roles in the group blurry. Often, an engineer can have the insight that makes it clear how the product’s design should work, or vice-versa — a designer can have the insight that helps the engineers understand how to better use the data. Or it may take someone from marketing to understand what a customer really wants to accomplish.<a id="a1">[#](#f1 "Data Therapy: You Don’t Need a Data Scientist, You Need a Data Culture")</a>


| Map some of these people onto your workflow. Who fits in where?                                    |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: Where do you fit on this spectrum of people?                                            |
| :question:  would you like to be?                                                                  |
| :question: What are the key differences between them?                                              |
| :question: What are some of the more important skills which align with where you would like to be? |
| :question: Where do you see gaps in your organisation with respect to these roles?                 |
| :question: How might you start bridging those gaps?                                                |

#### Mapping Interfaces

| Map out the interfaces between your team members considering how you work.                             |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :question: Who manages these interfaces?                                                               |
| :question: What (data/code/information) needs to flow across them?                                     |
| :question: What does effective leadership look like in a data-focused team?<sup id="a3">[#](#f3)</sup> |


| Map interfaces from your data team to the rest of the business.                         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: What needs to be supported once you’ve built something?                  |
| :question: Who provides that support?                                               |
| :question: Who funds your work?                                                     |
| :question: How do you measure ongoing value? How do you know when things go wrong?  |
| :question: Who manages the new datasets that you’re creating?                       |
| :question: Who helps others get confident with the new processes you’ve introduced? |

Note that all of these interfaces are potential communication barriers.

<b id="f3">#</b> One suggestion: Communicate the 'why' (through your data plans/strategy) - let your team own the 'how'. You don’t need to know implementation details! [↩](#a3)
