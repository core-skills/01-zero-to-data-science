# Getting From Here to There

##	What is my existing data culture?
1.	What needs to change?
1.  Dealing with roadblocks
Different stages of ideas about data science:
1. Data are columns in spreadsheets and not connected to business decisions
1. Data are connected to decisions through descriptive statistics (mean, percentiles, range), visualization (what plot is appropriate) and inferential statistics (when does the data support the conclusions)? Train people to make fewer assumptions and plot the data for themselves
1.Modelling process – coming up with your own models for the data making predictions of future states from current states
1. Creating data products – making data speak for others through services and automated predictions

Data Management
1. Data are spread out over the organization with no central point to get data from  
1. Data are pooled and accessible to all staff with descriptive formats
1. Data lifecycles are managed with old data retired. Code and pipelines are managed.
1. Code and pipelines and servers are reused across the organization to add value across silos

Communication ideas:
1.	Data are not recognized
1.	Basic metrics are available and used to drive decisions routinely in other business processes
1.	Data are used to tell stories & show impact
1.	Data are used to argue for particular courses of action

Relate these back to the three roadblocks:
1.	**confidence** – how do we build confidence in our skills?
2.	**technology** – what platforms should we use and what investments made to get ourselves to the next level?
3.	**process** – what can my organization do to make it easier to get to the next level on the hierarchy?

Understanding what already exists within your team before you try to change a bunch of things:

*	Are there data champions already using data in good ways that you can celebrate as good role models?
*	Are there roles in your organization aligned with your data needs?
*	Is there a central person or team setting policies and best practices when it comes to your data related work?
*	Are there things that are going to break when I introduce a new process?


## What needs to change?


## Dealing with roadblocks

**Confusion**

Need to use communication methods and language that meets people where they are You will need to teach others to interpret your outputs for themselves

**Not knowing your own data**

How will you keep track of data and assets (more on this tomorrow) How do you identify useful datasets?

**Organizational Silos**

Acknowledge walls but demonstrate value when broken down

**IT-centric thinking**

Infrastructure specific thinking (if I just have a Hadoop platform my analytics problems will be solved) – data is for everybody and Excel is just as much a useful tool as the best biggest data platform – create more invitations for people to work with data

**Irrelevance**

If staff don’t understand the utility of the data they are collecting you will get shit data – KPIs not a key driver – you need staff to understand ‘so what’ – make it relevant to them (often they will know the relevance better than you!)

**Boredom**

Make data something that can be fun for people – creative times to generate new things from data – tell stories about your data share these – data are more than pivot tables!

**HiPPOs (Highest Paid Person’s Opinions)**

When someone more powerful than you just wants to ‘trust their gut’ – importance of experimentation and establishing baselines!
