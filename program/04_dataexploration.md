## Data Exploration: Understanding What's There
### Context

| :question: **Where has my data come from?**                |
|:---------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: **Who collected it & why?**                     |
| :question: **Can it answer the problem I want to tackle?** |
| :question: **How quickly can I get there?**                |


| :question: **Who is responsible for collecting your data?**         |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: **Who is responsible for Quality Assurance and Control?** |
| :question: **Why and when can QA/QC fail?**                          |
| :question: **How can we demonstrate the value of this work?[*]**     |

[*]: _  "So it’s not just another chore..."

### Tools for Data Exploration


< Example >

| :question: **What’s gone wrong so far?** |
|:---------------------------------------- |

### Making Data Useful

#### FAIR

#### Tidy Data

#### Data Management: Storage and Access

| Map out those who have need for access to data.             |
|:----------------------------------------------------------- |
| :question: **Who do you have to deal with to access data?** |
| :question: **Who needs access to the data?**                |
| :question: **How do their needs differ?**                   |

2.	Compare SQL and NoSQL? When we only have SQL our view of data becomes dominated by tools optimized for consuming data not mining new value from it. Data sci requires intuitive access & semi-structured data – allows iterative manipulation – CF data flow languages


How can we have an environment where we can make changes as necessary? (a Data Sandbox?)
3.	How can we get space to make changes? -> Data sandbox! What might that look lik	e (cloud? Hadoop? On prem? Special computers?)
4.	What do we do with cleaned data? -> Data management and lifecycle considerations.


### Data Visualisation

| :question: Discuss how we speed up data exploration? |
