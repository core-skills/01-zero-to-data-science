# Core skills program - week 1 - Zero to data science

**todo**: Add Binder badge to open this folder in Binder

The aim of today's session will be to take you though a 'typical' data science workflow. We won't be going into any detail but rather aim to show you all the parts and how they fit together; as the course progresses we'll fill in the details 

You should aim to have an understanding of the basic parts of a data science project, and be starting to get familiar with using git, Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

Throughout the course we will attempt to stick some interesting links in this document for you to follow up on at your own leisure. These are not compulsory (we realise everyone is busy!) but if you've got some downtime on the train they might be interesting to look at.
